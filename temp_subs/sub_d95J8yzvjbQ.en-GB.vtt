help me write code?

&lt;i&gt;to answer questions,&lt;/i&gt;

00:00:40.199 --> 00:00:41.826
&lt;i&gt;but I'm able to learn.&lt;/i&gt;

LOVE: That's very
open-minded of you.

&lt;i&gt;I'm glad you're happy with me.&lt;/i&gt;

What do you think
he's working on?

00:00:59.093 --> 00:01:00.595
ALPHA:
&lt;i&gt;That's a tough question.&lt;/i&gt;

00:01:00.678 --> 00:01:02.513
&lt;i&gt;He might be working&lt;/i&gt;

It's quite possible.

&lt;i&gt;That's a badminton racket.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;So I set my heart&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;on studying neuroscience&lt;/i&gt;

00:03:34.207 --> 00:03:35.792

So you're going to come here

00:03:35.875 --> 00:03:37.835
and you're going
to study neuroscience

00:03:37.919 --> 00:03:40.963

get a Ph.D. if you work hard.

&lt;i&gt;is the only existent proof&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;we have, perhaps&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;that general intelligence&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;is possible at all.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;someone in this building&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;And then Shane's name&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;popped up.&lt;/i&gt;

00:04:04.529 --> 00:04:06.948
HOST: Our next speaker today
is Shane Legg.

00:04:07.031 --> 00:04:08.032
He's from New Zealand,

00:04:08.116 --> 00:04:11.244
where he trained in math
and classical ballet.

00:04:11.327 --> 00:04:13.663
Are machines actually
becoming more intelligent?

00:04:13.746 --> 00:04:15.998
Some people say yes,
some people say no.

00:04:16.082 --> 00:04:17.125
It's not really clear.

00:04:17.208 --> 00:04:18.376
We know they're getting
a lot faster

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:19.794
at doing computations.

00:04:19.877 --> 00:04:21.087
But are we actually
going forwards

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:23.339
in terms
of general intelligence?

00:04:23.423 --> 00:04:25.425
HASSABIS: &lt;i&gt;We were both&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;obsessed with AGI,&lt;/i&gt;

00:04:25.508 --> 00:04:27.176
&lt;i&gt;artificial&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;general intelligence.&lt;/i&gt;

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:28.511
So today I'm going
to be talking about

00:04:29.303 --> 00:04:31.681
different approaches
to building AGI.

00:04:31.764 --> 00:04:33.391
With my colleague
Demis Hassabis,

00:04:33.474 --> 00:04:35.393
we're looking at ways
to bring in ideas

00:04:35.476 --> 00:04:37.228
from theoretical neuroscience.

00:04:37.311 --> 00:04:41.065
I felt like we were
the keepers of a secret

00:04:41.149 --> 00:04:42.734
that no one else knew.

00:04:42.817 --> 00:04:45.069
&lt;i&gt;Shane and I knew&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;no one in academia&lt;/i&gt;

00:04:45.153 --> 00:04:47.321
&lt;i&gt;would be supportive&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;of what we were doing.&lt;/i&gt;

00:04:47.405 --> 00:04:50.366
AI was almost
an embarrassing word

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:52.368
to use in academic circles,
right?

00:04:52.452 --> 00:04:54.412
If you said
you were working on AI,

00:04:54.495 --> 00:04:56.914
then you clearly weren't
a serious scientist.

00:04:57.623 --> 00:04:59.667
&lt;i&gt;So I convinced Shane&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;the right way to do it&lt;/i&gt;

00:04:59.751 --> 00:05:00.835
&lt;i&gt;would be to start a company.&lt;/i&gt;

00:05:00.918 --> 00:05:02.795
SHANE LEGG: &lt;i&gt;Okay,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;we're going to try to do&lt;/i&gt;

00:05:02.879 --> 00:05:04.422
&lt;i&gt;artificial&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;general intelligence.&lt;/i&gt;

00:05:04.505 --> 00:05:06.466
It may not even be possible.

00:05:06.549 --> 00:05:08.134
We're not quite sure
how we're going to do it,

00:05:08.217 --> 00:05:10.261
but we have some ideas
or, kind of, approaches.

00:05:11.387 --> 00:05:13.765
Huge amounts of money,
huge amounts of risk,

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:16.059
lots and lots of compute.

00:05:18.311 --> 00:05:19.937
And if we pull this off,

00:05:20.021 --> 00:05:21.981
it'll be the biggest thing
ever, right?

00:05:23.316 --> 00:05:25.735
That is a very hard thing
for a typical investor

00:05:25.818 --> 00:05:26.986
to put their money on.

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:28.738
It's almost like
buying a lottery ticket.

00:05:29.405 --> 00:05:32.116
I'm going to be speaking about
the system of neuroscience

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:36.204
and how it might be used
to help us build AGI.

00:05:36.287 --> 00:05:37.455
HASSABIS:
&lt;i&gt;Finding initial funding&lt;/i&gt;

00:05:37.538 --> 00:05:38.664
&lt;i&gt;for this was very hard.&lt;/i&gt;

00:05:38.748 --> 00:05:40.833
&lt;i&gt;We're going to solve&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;all of intelligence.&lt;/i&gt;

00:05:40.917 --> 00:05:42.418
&lt;i&gt;You can imagine&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;some of the looks I got&lt;/i&gt;

00:05:42.502 --> 00:05:44.253
&lt;i&gt;when we were&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;pitching that around.&lt;/i&gt;

00:05:44.337 --> 00:05:47.423
So I'm a V.C.
and I look at about

00:05:47.507 --> 00:05:49.801
700 to 1,000 projects a year.

00:05:50.635 --> 00:05:54.263
And I fund
literally 1% of those.

00:05:54.347 --> 00:05:55.932
About eight projects a year.

00:05:56.766 --> 00:05:59.936
So that means 99% of the time,
you're in "No" mode.

00:06:00.019 --> 00:06:01.354
"Wait a minute.
I'm telling you,

00:06:01.437 --> 00:06:03.272
"this is the most important
thing of all time.

00:06:03.356 --> 00:06:04.732
"I'm giving you
all this build-up

00:06:04.816 --> 00:06:05.817
"about how... explain

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:06.943
"how it connects
with the brain,

00:06:07.026 --> 00:06:09.028
"why the time's right now,
and then you're asking me,

00:06:09.112 --> 00:06:10.571
"'But what's your, how are you
going to make money?

00:06:10.655 --> 00:06:11.698
"'What's your product?'"

00:06:11.781 --> 00:06:15.368
It's like,
so prosaic a question.

00:06:15.952 --> 00:06:17.036
You know?

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:18.746
"Have you not been listening
to what I've been saying?"

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:20.623
LEGG: &lt;i&gt;We needed investors&lt;/i&gt;

00:06:20.707 --> 00:06:23.126
&lt;i&gt;who aren't necessarily&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;going to invest&lt;/i&gt;

00:06:23.209 --> 00:06:24.711
&lt;i&gt;because they think&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;it's the best&lt;/i&gt;

00:06:24.794 --> 00:06:26.170
&lt;i&gt;investment decision.&lt;/i&gt;

00:06:26.254 --> 00:06:27.338
They're probably
going to invest

00:06:27.422 --> 00:06:29.173
because they just think
it's really cool.

00:06:29.257 --> 00:06:31.134

00:06:31.217 --> 00:06:33.136
&lt;i&gt;version of the man&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;behind the curtain&lt;/i&gt;

00:06:33.219 --> 00:06:34.387
&lt;i&gt;in &lt;/i&gt;The Wizard of Oz.

00:06:34.470 --> 00:06:35.847
&lt;i&gt;He had a lot to do&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;with giving you&lt;/i&gt;

00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:38.516
&lt;i&gt;PayPal, Facebook,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;YouTube and Yelp.&lt;/i&gt;

00:06:38.599 --> 00:06:40.059
LEGG: &lt;i&gt;If everyone says "X,"&lt;/i&gt;

00:06:40.143 --> 00:06:42.812
Peter Thiel suspects
that the opposite of X

00:06:42.895 --> 00:06:43.938
is quite possibly true.

00:06:44.022 --> 00:06:47.358
HASSABIS: &lt;i&gt;So Peter Thiel&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;was our first big investor.&lt;/i&gt;

00:06:47.442 --> 00:06:49.819
But he insisted that
we come to Silicon Valley

00:06:49.902 --> 00:06:51.320
because that
was the only place we could...

00:06:51.404 --> 00:06:52.530
There would be the talent,

00:06:52.613 --> 00:06:53.865
and we could build
that kind of company.

00:06:54.824 --> 00:06:56.492
&lt;i&gt;But I was pretty adamant&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;we should be in London&lt;/i&gt;

00:06:56.576 --> 00:06:58.578
&lt;i&gt;because I think&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;London's an amazing city.&lt;/i&gt;

00:06:58.661 --> 00:07:01.080
&lt;i&gt;Plus, I knew there were&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;really amazing people&lt;/i&gt;

00:07:01.164 --> 00:07:03.291
&lt;i&gt;trained at Cambridge&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;and Oxford and UCL.&lt;/i&gt;

00:07:03.374 --> 00:07:04.459
&lt;i&gt;In Silicon Valley,&lt;/i&gt;

00:07:04.542 --> 00:07:06.085
everybody's founding
a company every year,

00:07:06.169 --> 00:07:07.170
and then if it doesn't work,

00:07:07.253 --> 00:07:09.047
you chuck it
and you start something new.

00:07:09.130 --> 00:07:10.715
That is not conducive

00:07:10.798 --> 00:07:13.634
to a long-term
research challenge.

00:07:14.510 --> 00:07:16.929
&lt;i&gt;So we were totally&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;an outlier for him.&lt;/i&gt;

00:07:17.013 --> 00:07:19.849
Hi, everyone.
Welcome to DeepMind.

00:07:20.558 --> 00:07:22.060
So, what is our mission?

00:07:23.269 --> 00:07:24.520
We summarize it as...

00:07:25.521 --> 00:07:27.523
DeepMind's mission is to build
the world's first

00:07:27.607 --> 00:07:29.067
general learning machine.

00:07:29.150 --> 00:07:31.194
So we always stress the word
"general" and "learning" here

00:07:31.277 --> 00:07:32.362
are the key things.

00:07:32.445 --> 00:07:34.655
LEGG: &lt;i&gt;Our mission&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;was to build an AGI,&lt;/i&gt;

00:07:34.739 --> 00:07:36.449
&lt;i&gt;an artificial&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;general intelligence.&lt;/i&gt;

00:07:36.532 --> 00:07:39.952
And so that means that we need
a system which is general.

00:07:40.036 --> 00:07:41.746
It doesn't learn to do
one specific thing.

00:07:42.497 --> 00:07:44.582
&lt;i&gt;That's a really key part&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;of human intelligence.&lt;/i&gt;

00:07:44.665 --> 00:07:46.334
&lt;i&gt;We can learn to do&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;many, many things.&lt;/i&gt;

00:07:46.417 --> 00:07:48.378
It's going to, of course,
be a lot of hard work.

00:07:48.461 --> 00:07:50.588
But one of the things
that keeps me up at night

00:07:50.672 --> 00:07:52.715
is to not waste this
opportunity to, you know,

00:07:52.799 --> 00:07:54.008
to really make
a difference here,

00:07:54.092 --> 00:07:55.551
and have a big impact
on the world.

00:07:56.427 --> 00:07:57.679
LEGG: &lt;i&gt;The first people&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;that came&lt;/i&gt;

00:07:57.762 --> 00:07:59.847
&lt;i&gt;and joined DeepMind&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;really believed in the dream.&lt;/i&gt;

00:07:59.931 --> 00:08:01.641
&lt;i&gt;But this was, I think,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;one of the first times&lt;/i&gt;

00:08:01.724 --> 00:08:04.102
&lt;i&gt;they found a place&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;full of other dreamers.&lt;/i&gt;

00:08:04.185 --> 00:08:06.020
You know, we collected
this Manhattan Project,

00:08:06.104 --> 00:08:08.022
if you like,
together to solve AI.

00:08:08.106 --> 00:08:09.232
HELEN KING:
&lt;i&gt;In the first two years,&lt;/i&gt;

00:08:09.315 --> 00:08:10.316
&lt;i&gt;we were in total stealth mode.&lt;/i&gt;

00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:11.901
And so we couldn't
say to anyone

00:08:11.984 --> 00:08:14.237
what were we doing
or where we worked.

00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:15.363
It was all quite vague.

00:08:15.446 --> 00:08:17.281
BEN COPPIN: &lt;i&gt;It had&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;no public presence at all.&lt;/i&gt;

00:08:17.365 --> 00:08:18.449
&lt;i&gt;You couldn't&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;look at a website.&lt;/i&gt;

00:08:18.533 --> 00:08:20.660
&lt;i&gt;The office&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;was at a secret location.&lt;/i&gt;

00:08:20.743 --> 00:08:23.538
When we would interview people
in those early days,

00:08:23.621 --> 00:08:25.707
they would show up
very nervously.

00:08:25.790 --> 00:08:26.833
(LAUGHS)

00:08:26.916 --> 00:08:28.626
I had at least one candidate
who said,

00:08:29.419 --> 00:08:31.546
"I just messaged my wife
to tell her exactly

00:08:31.629 --> 00:08:32.672
"where I'm going just in case

00:08:32.755 --> 00:08:34.215
"this turns out to be some
kind of horrible scam

00:08:34.298 --> 00:08:35.341
"and I'm going
to get kidnapped."

00:08:35.425 --> 00:08:39.387
Well, my favorite new person
who's an investor,

00:08:39.470 --> 00:08:42.557
who I've been working
for a year, is Elon Musk.

00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:43.683
So for those of you
who don't know,

00:08:43.766 --> 00:08:44.767
this is what he looks like.

00:08:44.851 --> 00:08:46.936
And he hadn't really thought
much about AI

00:08:47.020 --> 00:08:48.688
until we chatted.

00:08:48.771 --> 00:08:50.857
His mission is to die on Mars
or something.

00:08:50.940 --> 00:08:52.483
-But not on impact.
-(LAUGHTER)

00:08:52.567 --> 00:08:53.609
So...

00:08:54.777 --> 00:08:56.696
&lt;i&gt;We made some big decisions&lt;/i&gt;

00:08:56.779 --> 00:08:58.906
about how we were going
to approach building AI.

00:08:58.990 --> 00:09:00.658
This is a reinforcement
learning setup.

00:09:00.742 --> 00:09:02.493
This is the kind of setup
that we think about

00:09:02.577 --> 00:09:05.663
when we say we're building,
you know, an AI agent.

00:09:05.747 --> 00:09:08.207
It's basically the agent,
which is the AI,

00:09:08.291 --> 00:09:09.500
and then there's
the environment

00:09:09.584 --> 00:09:10.793
that it's interacting with.

00:09:10.877 --> 00:09:12.086
&lt;i&gt;We decided that games,&lt;/i&gt;

00:09:12.170 --> 00:09:13.546
as long as
you're very disciplined

00:09:13.629 --> 00:09:14.881
about how you use them,

00:09:14.964 --> 00:09:16.883
are the perfect
training ground

00:09:16.966 --> 00:09:18.092
for AI development.

00:09:19.010 --> 00:09:21.429
LEGG: &lt;i&gt;We wanted&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;to try to create one algorithm&lt;/i&gt;

00:09:21.512 --> 00:09:23.389
&lt;i&gt;that could to be&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;trained up to play&lt;/i&gt;

00:09:23.473 --> 00:09:25.600
&lt;i&gt;several dozen&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;different Atari games.&lt;/i&gt;

00:09:25.683 --> 00:09:26.684
So just like a human,

00:09:26.768 --> 00:09:29.145
you have to use the same brain
to play all the games.

00:09:29.228 --> 00:09:30.480
DAVID SILVER:
&lt;i&gt;You can think of it&lt;/i&gt;

00:09:30.563 --> 00:09:32.607
&lt;i&gt;that you provide the agent&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;with the cartridge.&lt;/i&gt;

00:09:32.690 --> 00:09:33.691
&lt;i&gt;And you say,&lt;/i&gt;

00:09:33.775 --> 00:09:35.234
&lt;i&gt;"Okay, imagine you're born&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;into that world&lt;/i&gt;

00:09:35.318 --> 00:09:37.236
"with that cartridge,
and you just get to interact

00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:38.863
"with the pixels
and see the score.

00:09:40.031 --> 00:09:41.240
"What can you do?"

00:09:43.743 --> 00:09:46.954
So what you're going to do is
take your Q function. Q-K...

00:09:47.038 --> 00:09:48.790
HASSABIS: &lt;i&gt;Q-learning&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;is one of the oldest methods&lt;/i&gt;

00:09:48.873 --> 00:09:50.124
&lt;i&gt;for reinforcement learning.&lt;/i&gt;

00:09:50.708 --> 00:09:53.378
&lt;i&gt;And what we did was combine&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;reinforcement learning&lt;/i&gt;

00:09:53.461 --> 00:09:55.546
&lt;i&gt;with deep learning&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;in one system.&lt;/i&gt;

00:09:56.547 --> 00:09:58.925
&lt;i&gt;No one had ever combined&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;those two things together&lt;/i&gt;

00:09:59.008 --> 00:10:01.052
&lt;i&gt;at scale to do&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;anything impressive,&lt;/i&gt;

00:10:01.135 --> 00:10:03.137
&lt;i&gt;and we needed&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;to prove out this thesis.&lt;/i&gt;

00:10:03.221 --> 00:10:06.265
LEGG: &lt;i&gt;We tried doing &lt;/i&gt;Pong
&lt;i&gt;as the first game.&lt;/i&gt;

00:10:06.349 --> 00:10:07.684
&lt;i&gt;It seemed like the simplest.&lt;/i&gt;

It hasn't been told

00:10:09.852 --> 00:10:11.312
anything about
what it's controlling

00:10:11.396 --> 00:10:12.397
or what it's supposed to do.

00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:14.315
All it knows
is that score is good

00:10:14.399 --> 00:10:17.568
and it has to learn
what its controls do,

00:10:17.652 --> 00:10:20.113
and build everything...
first principles.

It wasn't really working.

thinking how far we had to go

if we were going
to really build

00:10:42.010 --> 00:10:44.012
a generally
intelligent system.

00:10:44.095 --> 00:10:45.221

00:10:51.060 --> 00:10:52.228
&lt;i&gt;We got our first point.&lt;/i&gt;

It was really exciting
that this thing

00:11:00.445 --> 00:11:01.821

&lt;i&gt;a few points.&lt;/i&gt;

00:11:08.036 --> 00:11:10.705
&lt;i&gt;And then three months later,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;no human could beat it.&lt;/i&gt;

00:11:10.788 --> 00:11:13.791
&lt;i&gt;You hadn't told it the rules,&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;to maximize the score,&lt;/i&gt;

00:11:15.752 --> 00:11:17.003

&lt;i&gt;we tried &lt;/i&gt;Breakout.

00:11:27.221 --> 00:11:28.639
At the beginning,
after 100 games,

00:11:28.723 --> 00:11:30.475
the agent is not very good.

00:11:30.558 --> 00:11:32.060
It's missing the ball
most of the time,

00:11:32.143 --> 00:11:33.978
but it's starting to get
the hang of the idea

00:11:34.062 --> 00:11:35.521
that the bat should go
towards the ball.

&lt;i&gt;any human can play this.&lt;/i&gt;

We thought,
"Well, that's pretty cool,"

for another 200 games,

00:11:43.988 --> 00:11:45.573

It found the optimal strategy

00:11:47.033 --> 00:11:48.993
was to dig a tunnel
around the side

00:11:49.077 --> 00:11:50.745
and put the ball
around the back of the wall.

00:11:56.959 --> 00:11:58.836
Like, I mean,
when we do research,

00:11:58.920 --> 00:12:00.296
that is the best
we can hope for.

00:12:00.380 --> 00:12:02.757
&lt;i&gt;We started generalizing&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;to 50 games,&lt;/i&gt;

00:12:02.840 --> 00:12:05.093
&lt;i&gt;and we basically&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;created a recipe.&lt;/i&gt;

00:12:05.176 --> 00:12:06.511
&lt;i&gt;We could just take a game&lt;/i&gt;

00:12:06.594 --> 00:12:07.970
&lt;i&gt;that we have&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;never seen before.&lt;/i&gt;

00:12:08.054 --> 00:12:09.597
&lt;i&gt;We would run&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;the algorithm on that,&lt;/i&gt;

00:12:09.681 --> 00:12:12.558
&lt;i&gt;and DQN could train itself&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;from scratch,&lt;/i&gt;

00:12:12.642 --> 00:12:14.018
&lt;i&gt;achieving human level&lt;/i&gt;

00:12:14.102 --> 00:12:15.770
&lt;i&gt;or sometimes better&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;than human level.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;to play any of them.&lt;/i&gt;

00:12:18.106 --> 00:12:20.108
We could just give it
a bunch of games

00:12:20.191 --> 00:12:21.651
and would figure it out
for itself.

00:12:22.360 --> 00:12:24.737
And there was something
quite magical in that.

MURRAY SHANAHAN:
&lt;i&gt;Suddenly you had something&lt;/i&gt;

00:12:26.197 --> 00:12:27.657
&lt;i&gt;that would respond and learn&lt;/i&gt;

00:12:27.740 --> 00:12:29.951
&lt;i&gt;whatever situation&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;it was parachuted into.&lt;/i&gt;

00:12:30.034 --> 00:12:32.537
&lt;i&gt;And that was like a huge,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;huge breakthrough.&lt;/i&gt;

00:12:32.620 --> 00:12:34.330
&lt;i&gt;It was in many respects&lt;/i&gt;

the first example

00:12:36.332 --> 00:12:38.584

00:12:38.668 --> 00:12:39.961
a general intelligence.

HASSABIS: &lt;i&gt;Although we were&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;a well-funded startup,&lt;/i&gt;

00:12:43.673 --> 00:12:45.967
&lt;i&gt;holding us back&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;was not enough compute power.&lt;/i&gt;

00:12:47.051 --> 00:12:48.761
&lt;i&gt;I realized that&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;this would accelerate&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;to AGI massively.&lt;/i&gt;

00:12:51.139 --> 00:12:52.682
I used to see Demis
quite frequently.

00:12:52.765 --> 00:12:54.475
We'd have lunch, and he did...

00:12:55.768 --> 00:12:58.563
say to me that
he had two companies

00:12:58.646 --> 00:13:01.357
that were involved
in buying DeepMind.

00:13:02.233 --> 00:13:04.235
And he didn't know
which one to go with.

00:13:04.318 --> 00:13:08.114
&lt;i&gt;The issue was,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;would any commercial company&lt;/i&gt;

00:13:08.197 --> 00:13:11.576
&lt;i&gt;appreciate the real importance&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;of the research?&lt;/i&gt;

00:13:12.368 --> 00:13:15.538
And give the research time
to come to fruition

00:13:15.621 --> 00:13:17.457
and not be breathing down
their necks,

00:13:17.540 --> 00:13:20.960
&lt;i&gt;saying, "We want some kind of&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;commercial benefit from this."&lt;/i&gt;

(MACHINERY HUMMING)

00:13:27.050 --> 00:13:31.512
Google has bought DeepMind
for a reported £400,000,000,

00:13:32.180 --> 00:13:34.349
making the artificial
intelligence firm

00:13:34.432 --> 00:13:37.435
its largest
European acquisition so far.

00:13:37.518 --> 00:13:39.270
&lt;i&gt;The company was founded&lt;/i&gt;

00:13:39.354 --> 00:13:42.398
&lt;i&gt;by 37-year-old entrepreneur&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Demis Hassabis.&lt;/i&gt;

00:13:42.982 --> 00:13:45.151
After the acquisition,
I started mentoring

00:13:45.234 --> 00:13:46.778
and spending time with Demis,

00:13:46.861 --> 00:13:48.029
and just listening to him.

00:13:48.738 --> 00:13:51.449
And this is a person
who fundamentally

00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:54.619
is a scientist
and a natural scientist.

00:13:55.244 --> 00:13:58.081
He wants science to solve
every problem in the world,

00:13:58.164 --> 00:13:59.665
and he believes it can do so.

00:14:00.291 --> 00:14:03.086
That's not a normal person
you find in a tech company.

00:14:05.088 --> 00:14:07.006
HASSABIS: We were able
to not only join Google

00:14:07.090 --> 00:14:09.759

which was optimized
for breakthroughs

00:14:13.096 --> 00:14:14.430
and not deal with products,

&lt;i&gt;Our investors&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;didn't want to sell,&lt;/i&gt;

00:14:18.976 --> 00:14:19.977
&lt;i&gt;but we decided&lt;/i&gt;

00:14:20.061 --> 00:14:21.813
&lt;i&gt;that this was the best thing&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;for the mission.&lt;/i&gt;

00:14:22.605 --> 00:14:24.232
&lt;i&gt;In many senses,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;we were underselling&lt;/i&gt;

00:14:24.315 --> 00:14:25.858
&lt;i&gt;in terms of value&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;before it more matured,&lt;/i&gt;

00:14:25.942 --> 00:14:27.193
&lt;i&gt;and you could have sold it&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;for a lot more money.&lt;/i&gt;

00:14:27.902 --> 00:14:31.114
&lt;i&gt;And the reason is because&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;there's no time to waste.&lt;/i&gt;

00:14:45.545 --> 00:14:47.922
to do what you set out to do?

00:14:48.006 --> 00:14:49.132
Okay, all of a sudden,

00:14:49.215 --> 00:14:51.968
we've got this massive scale
compute available to us.

00:14:52.468 --> 00:14:53.469
What can we do with that?

&lt;i&gt;at this game&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;and they've thought,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;"Wow, this is just too hard."&lt;/i&gt;

00:15:17.702 --> 00:15:19.871
Everything we've ever
tried in AI,

00:15:19.954 --> 00:15:22.290
it just falls over when
you try the game of Go.

00:15:22.373 --> 00:15:23.666
&lt;i&gt;And so that's why&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;it feels like&lt;/i&gt;

00:15:23.750 --> 00:15:25.585
&lt;i&gt;a real litmus test&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;of progress.&lt;/i&gt;

00:15:25.668 --> 00:15:28.171
We had just bought DeepMind.

00:15:28.254 --> 00:15:30.340
They were working
on reinforcement learning

00:15:30.423 --> 00:15:32.633
&lt;i&gt;and they were the world's&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;experts in games.&lt;/i&gt;

00:15:32.717 --> 00:15:34.469
&lt;i&gt;And so when&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;they introduced the idea&lt;/i&gt;

00:15:34.552 --> 00:15:36.888
&lt;i&gt;that they could beat&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;the top level Go players&lt;/i&gt;

00:15:36.971 --> 00:15:39.807
&lt;i&gt;in a game that was thought&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;to be incomputable,&lt;/i&gt;

00:15:39.891 --> 00:15:41.893

that's pretty interesting."

&lt;i&gt;one of the greatest players&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;of the last decade.&lt;/i&gt;

00:16:01.329 --> 00:16:03.831
&lt;i&gt;I describe him&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;as the Roger Federer of Go.&lt;/i&gt;

00:16:06.542 --> 00:16:09.462
&lt;i&gt;and all of a sudden&lt;/i&gt;

for very creative
fighting play.

&lt;i&gt;difficult for us.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;a new algorithm,&lt;/i&gt;

00:20:56.666 --> 00:20:58.793
&lt;i&gt;a much more elegant approach&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;to the whole system,&lt;/i&gt;

00:20:58.876 --> 00:21:00.795
which actually stripped out
all of the human knowledge

00:21:00.878 --> 00:21:02.755
and just started
completely from scratch.

00:21:03.506 --> 00:21:06.426
&lt;i&gt;And that became a project&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;which we called AlphaZero.&lt;/i&gt;

00:21:06.509 --> 00:21:09.137
&lt;i&gt;Zero, meaning having zero&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;human knowledge in the loop.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;from human data,&lt;/i&gt;

00:21:12.807 --> 00:21:13.975
&lt;i&gt;it learned from its own games.&lt;/i&gt;

00:21:15.601 --> 00:21:17.228
&lt;i&gt;So it actually&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;became its own teacher.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;AlphaZero is an experiment&lt;/i&gt;

00:21:23.276 --> 00:21:26.279
&lt;i&gt;in how little knowledge&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;can we put into these systems&lt;/i&gt;

00:21:26.362 --> 00:21:27.697
&lt;i&gt;and how quickly&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;and how efficiently&lt;/i&gt;

00:21:27.780 --> 00:21:28.781
&lt;i&gt;can they learn?&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;have any rules.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;It learns through experience.&lt;/i&gt;

00:21:35.747 --> 00:21:38.416
&lt;i&gt;The next stage&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;was to make it more general,&lt;/i&gt;

00:21:38.499 --> 00:21:40.626
&lt;i&gt;so that it could play&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;any two-player game.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;to take a few months to train,&lt;/i&gt;

00:21:52.722 --> 00:21:55.183
&lt;i&gt;but AlphaZero could start&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;in the morning&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;and I was at this&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;international chess tournament&lt;/i&gt;

00:24:31.714 --> 00:24:33.675
&lt;i&gt;in Liechtenstein&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;up in the mountains.&lt;/i&gt;

00:24:36.052 --> 00:24:38.763
(BELL TOLLING)

00:24:42.975 --> 00:24:44.227
&lt;i&gt;And we were in this&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;huge church hall&lt;/i&gt;

00:24:46.854 --> 00:24:47.855
&lt;i&gt;with, you know,&lt;/i&gt;

00:24:47.939 --> 00:24:49.440
&lt;i&gt;hundreds of international&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;chess players.&lt;/i&gt;

00:24:52.068 --> 00:24:54.362
&lt;i&gt;And I was playing&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;the ex-Danish champion.&lt;/i&gt;

00:24:55.655 --> 00:24:57.949
&lt;i&gt;He must have been&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;in his 30s, probably.&lt;/i&gt;

00:25:00.076 --> 00:25:01.911
&lt;i&gt;In those days,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;there was a long time limit.&lt;/i&gt;

00:25:02.620 --> 00:25:03.871
&lt;i&gt;The games could&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;literally last all day.&lt;/i&gt;

00:25:05.081 --> 00:25:06.791
(YAWNS)

00:25:08.001 --> 00:25:09.002
(TIMER TICKING)

00:25:09.085 --> 00:25:10.336
&lt;i&gt;We were into our tenth hour.&lt;/i&gt;

00:25:10.420 --> 00:25:11.838
(TIMER TICKS FRANTICALLY)

00:25:19.887 --> 00:25:21.973
&lt;i&gt;And we were in this&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;incredibly unusual ending.&lt;/i&gt;

00:25:22.724 --> 00:25:24.100
&lt;i&gt;I think it should be a draw.&lt;/i&gt;

00:25:26.102 --> 00:25:28.229
&lt;i&gt;But he kept on trying&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;to win for hours.&lt;/i&gt;

00:25:31.858 --> 00:25:32.859
(HORSE NEIGHS)

00:25:35.278 --> 00:25:37.572
&lt;i&gt;Finally, he tried&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;one last cheap trick.&lt;/i&gt;

00:25:42.243 --> 00:25:44.162
&lt;i&gt;All I had to do&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;was give away my queen.&lt;/i&gt;

00:25:44.245 --> 00:25:45.246
&lt;i&gt;Then it would be stalemate.&lt;/i&gt;

00:25:46.622 --> 00:25:47.665
&lt;i&gt;But I was so tired,&lt;/i&gt;

00:25:47.749 --> 00:25:49.584
&lt;i&gt;I thought it was inevitable&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;I was going to be checkmated.&lt;/i&gt;

00:25:51.961 --> 00:25:53.004
&lt;i&gt;And so I resigned.&lt;/i&gt;

00:25:56.924 --> 00:25:59.010
&lt;i&gt;He jumped up.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Just started laughing.&lt;/i&gt;

00:25:59.093 --> 00:26:00.094
(LAUGHING)

00:26:01.304 --> 00:26:02.347
&lt;i&gt;And he went,&lt;/i&gt;

00:26:02.430 --> 00:26:03.765
&lt;i&gt;"Why have you resigned?&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;It's a draw."&lt;/i&gt;

00:26:03.848 --> 00:26:04.932
&lt;i&gt;And he immediately,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;with a flourish,&lt;/i&gt;

00:26:05.016 --> 00:26:06.225
&lt;i&gt;sort of showed me&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;the drawing move.&lt;/i&gt;

00:26:08.811 --> 00:26:10.396
&lt;i&gt;I felt so sick to my stomach.&lt;/i&gt;

00:26:12.315 --> 00:26:13.691
&lt;i&gt;It made me think of&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;the rest of that tournament.&lt;/i&gt;

00:26:13.775 --> 00:26:15.485
&lt;i&gt;Like, are we wasting&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;our minds?&lt;/i&gt;

00:26:16.402 --> 00:26:19.405
&lt;i&gt;Is this the best use&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;of all this brain power?&lt;/i&gt;

00:26:19.489 --> 00:26:21.449
&lt;i&gt;Everybody's, collectively,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;in that building?&lt;/i&gt;

00:26:22.075 --> 00:26:23.618
&lt;i&gt;If you could somehow plug in&lt;/i&gt;

00:26:23.701 --> 00:26:26.537
&lt;i&gt;those 300 brains&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;into a system,&lt;/i&gt;

00:26:27.580 --> 00:26:28.581
&lt;i&gt;you might be able&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;to solve cancer&lt;/i&gt;

00:26:28.664 --> 00:26:29.957
&lt;i&gt;with that level&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;of brain power.&lt;/i&gt;

00:26:31.376 --> 00:26:33.211
&lt;i&gt;This intuitive feeling&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;came over me&lt;/i&gt;

00:26:33.294 --> 00:26:34.837
&lt;i&gt;that although I love chess,&lt;/i&gt;

00:26:34.921 --> 00:26:37.632
&lt;i&gt;this is not the right thing&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;to spend my whole life on.&lt;/i&gt;

00:26:51.187 --> 00:26:52.647
LEGG: &lt;i&gt;Demis and myself,&lt;/i&gt;

00:26:52.730 --> 00:26:55.650
&lt;i&gt;our plan was always&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;to fill DeepMind&lt;/i&gt;

00:26:55.733 --> 00:26:56.818
&lt;i&gt;with some of the most&lt;/i&gt;

00:26:56.901 --> 00:26:58.069
&lt;i&gt;brilliant scientists&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;in the world.&lt;/i&gt;

00:26:58.861 --> 00:27:00.571
&lt;i&gt;So we had the human brains&lt;/i&gt;

00:27:00.655 --> 00:27:03.282
&lt;i&gt;necessary to create&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;an AGI system.&lt;/i&gt;

00:27:04.742 --> 00:27:07.870
&lt;i&gt;By definition, the "G"&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;in AGI is about generality.&lt;/i&gt;

00:27:08.955 --> 00:27:12.667
&lt;i&gt;What I imagine is being able&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;to talk to an agent,&lt;/i&gt;

00:27:12.750 --> 00:27:13.751
&lt;i&gt;the agent can talk back,&lt;/i&gt;

00:27:14.836 --> 00:27:18.423
&lt;i&gt;and the agent is able to solve&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;novel problems&lt;/i&gt;

00:27:18.506 --> 00:27:19.632
&lt;i&gt;that it hasn't seen before.&lt;/i&gt;

00:27:20.299 --> 00:27:22.468
&lt;i&gt;That's a really key part&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;of human intelligence,&lt;/i&gt;

00:27:22.552 --> 00:27:24.095
&lt;i&gt;and it's that&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;cognitive breadth&lt;/i&gt;

00:27:24.178 --> 00:27:26.139
&lt;i&gt;and flexibility&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;that's incredible.&lt;/i&gt;

00:27:27.515 --> 00:27:29.142
&lt;i&gt;The only natural&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;general intelligence&lt;/i&gt;

00:27:29.225 --> 00:27:30.226
&lt;i&gt;we know of as humans,&lt;/i&gt;

00:27:30.309 --> 00:27:31.728
&lt;i&gt;we obviously learn a lot&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;from our environment.&lt;/i&gt;

00:27:33.104 --> 00:27:35.606
&lt;i&gt;So we think that&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;simulated environments&lt;/i&gt;

00:27:35.690 --> 00:27:38.151
&lt;i&gt;are one of the ways&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;to create an AGI.&lt;/i&gt;

00:27:40.361 --> 00:27:41.404
SIMON CARTER:
&lt;i&gt;The very early humans&lt;/i&gt;

00:27:42.030 --> 00:27:43.906
&lt;i&gt;were having to solve&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;logic problems.&lt;/i&gt;

00:27:43.990 --> 00:27:46.451
&lt;i&gt;They were having to solve&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;navigation, memory,&lt;/i&gt;

00:27:46.534 --> 00:27:48.453
&lt;i&gt;and we evolved&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;in that environment.&lt;/i&gt;

00:27:49.954 --> 00:27:52.165
If we can create
a virtual recreation

00:27:52.248 --> 00:27:54.334
of that kind of environment,

00:27:54.417 --> 00:27:55.960
that's the perfect
testing ground

00:27:56.044 --> 00:27:57.086
and training ground

00:27:57.170 --> 00:27:58.755
for everything
we do at DeepMind.

00:28:03.843 --> 00:28:05.386
GUY SIMMONS:
&lt;i&gt;What they were doing here&lt;/i&gt;

00:28:05.470 --> 00:28:08.806
&lt;i&gt;was creating environments&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;for childlike beings,&lt;/i&gt;

00:28:08.890 --> 00:28:11.184
&lt;i&gt;the agents to exist&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;within and play.&lt;/i&gt;

00:28:12.101 --> 00:28:13.186
That just sounded like

00:28:13.269 --> 00:28:15.271
the most interesting thing
in all the world.

00:28:16.522 --> 00:28:18.649
SHANAHAN: &lt;i&gt;A child&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;learns by tearing things up&lt;/i&gt;

00:28:18.733 --> 00:28:20.318
&lt;i&gt;and then throwing food around&lt;/i&gt;

00:28:20.401 --> 00:28:22.362
&lt;i&gt;and getting a response&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;from mommy or daddy.&lt;/i&gt;

00:28:23.029 --> 00:28:25.323
This seems like an important
idea to incorporate

00:28:25.406 --> 00:28:26.949
in the way you train an agent.

00:28:27.658 --> 00:28:29.827
RESEARCHER 1: The humanoid
is supposed to stand up.

00:28:30.620 --> 00:28:32.455
As his center
of gravity rises,

00:28:32.538 --> 00:28:33.998
it gets more points.

00:28:37.126 --> 00:28:38.544
You have a reward

00:28:38.628 --> 00:28:40.505
and the agent
learns from the reward,

00:28:40.588 --> 00:28:42.965
&lt;i&gt;like, you do something well,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;you get a positive reward.&lt;/i&gt;

00:28:43.049 --> 00:28:46.010
&lt;i&gt;You do something bad,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;you get a negative reward.&lt;/i&gt;

00:28:47.178 --> 00:28:48.805
RESEARCHER 2: (EXCLAIMS)
It looks like it's standing.

00:28:50.390 --> 00:28:51.724
It's still a bit drunk.

00:28:51.808 --> 00:28:53.309
RESEARCHER 1:
It likes to walk backwards.

00:28:53.393 --> 00:28:54.394
RESEARCHER 2: (CHUCKLES) Yeah.

00:28:54.977 --> 00:28:57.146
The whole algorithm
is trying to optimize

00:28:57.230 --> 00:28:59.357
for receiving as much rewards
as possible,

00:28:59.440 --> 00:29:01.859
and it's found that
walking backwards,

00:29:01.943 --> 00:29:04.779
it's good enough
to get very good scores.

00:29:07.448 --> 00:29:08.658
RAIA HADSELL:
&lt;i&gt;When we learn to navigate,&lt;/i&gt;

00:29:09.283 --> 00:29:10.827
&lt;i&gt;when we learn to get around&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;in our world,&lt;/i&gt;

00:29:10.910 --> 00:29:12.495
&lt;i&gt;we don't start with maps.&lt;/i&gt;

00:29:13.162 --> 00:29:15.373
&lt;i&gt;We just start&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;with our own exploration,&lt;/i&gt;

00:29:15.957 --> 00:29:17.542
adventuring off
across the park,

00:29:17.625 --> 00:29:20.461
without our parents
by our side,

00:29:21.671 --> 00:29:23.756
or finding our way home
from school when we're young.

00:29:23.965 --> 00:29:24.966
(FAST ELECTRONIC
MUSIC PLAYING)

00:29:26.634 --> 00:29:28.344
HADSELL: &lt;i&gt;A few of us&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;came up with this idea&lt;/i&gt;

00:29:28.428 --> 00:29:31.472
&lt;i&gt;that if we had an environment&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;where a simulated robot&lt;/i&gt;

00:29:31.556 --> 00:29:33.349
&lt;i&gt;just had to run forward,&lt;/i&gt;

00:29:33.433 --> 00:29:35.852
&lt;i&gt;we could put all sorts of&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;obstacles in its way&lt;/i&gt;

00:29:35.935 --> 00:29:37.770
&lt;i&gt;and see if it could manage&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;to navigate&lt;/i&gt;

00:29:37.854 --> 00:29:39.522
&lt;i&gt;different types of terrain.&lt;/i&gt;

00:29:40.314 --> 00:29:42.650
The idea would be like
a parkour challenge.

00:29:46.029 --> 00:29:47.405
&lt;i&gt;It's not graceful,&lt;/i&gt;

00:29:48.489 --> 00:29:51.284
&lt;i&gt;but was never trained to hold&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;a glass whilst it was running&lt;/i&gt;

00:29:51.367 --> 00:29:52.660
&lt;i&gt;and not spill water.&lt;/i&gt;

00:29:53.745 --> 00:29:55.329
You set this objective
that says,

00:29:55.413 --> 00:29:57.790
"Just move forward,
forward velocity,

00:29:57.874 --> 00:29:59.083
"and you'll get
a reward for that."

00:30:00.293 --> 00:30:02.295
&lt;i&gt;And the learning algorithm&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;figures out&lt;/i&gt;

00:30:02.378 --> 00:30:04.797
&lt;i&gt;how to move&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;this complex set of joints.&lt;/i&gt;

00:30:05.715 --> 00:30:06.924
&lt;i&gt;That's the power of&lt;/i&gt;

00:30:07.008 --> 00:30:08.968
&lt;i&gt;reward-based&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;reinforcement learning.&lt;/i&gt;

00:30:09.886 --> 00:30:12.388
SILVER: &lt;i&gt;Our goal&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;is to try and build agents&lt;/i&gt;

00:30:12.472 --> 00:30:15.433
&lt;i&gt;which, we drop them in,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;they know nothing,&lt;/i&gt;

00:30:15.516 --> 00:30:18.186
&lt;i&gt;they get to play around in&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;whatever problem you give them&lt;/i&gt;

00:30:18.269 --> 00:30:20.897
&lt;i&gt;and eventually figure out how&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;to solve it for themselves.&lt;/i&gt;

00:30:21.981 --> 00:30:24.484
Now we want something
which can do that

00:30:24.567 --> 00:30:26.778
in as many different types
of problems as possible.

00:30:29.030 --> 00:30:32.367
&lt;i&gt;A human needs diverse skills&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;to interact with the world.&lt;/i&gt;

00:30:32.742 --> 00:30:34.744
&lt;i&gt;How to deal&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;with complex images,&lt;/i&gt;

00:30:34.827 --> 00:30:37.538
&lt;i&gt;how to manipulate&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;thousands of things at once,&lt;/i&gt;

00:30:37.622 --> 00:30:39.540
&lt;i&gt;how to deal&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;with missing information.&lt;/i&gt;

00:30:40.083 --> 00:30:41.709
&lt;i&gt;We think all of these things&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;together&lt;/i&gt;

00:30:41.793 --> 00:30:43.920
&lt;i&gt;are represented&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;by this game called&lt;/i&gt; StarCraft.

00:30:44.921 --> 00:30:46.839
All it's being trained
to do is,

00:30:46.923 --> 00:30:50.051
given this situation,
this screen,

00:30:50.134 --> 00:30:51.427
what would a human do?

00:30:51.511 --> 00:30:54.764
&lt;i&gt;We took inspiration from&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;large language models&lt;/i&gt;

00:30:54.847 --> 00:30:57.308
where you simply train
a model

00:30:57.392 --> 00:30:58.976
to predict the next word,

00:31:03.439 --> 00:31:05.024
&lt;i&gt;which is exactly the same as&lt;/i&gt;

00:31:05.108 --> 00:31:07.402
&lt;i&gt;predict the next&lt;/i&gt;
StarCraft &lt;i&gt;move.&lt;/i&gt;

00:31:07.485 --> 00:31:08.486
SILVER: &lt;i&gt;Unlike chess or Go,&lt;/i&gt;

00:31:08.569 --> 00:31:10.947
&lt;i&gt;where players take turns&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;to make moves,&lt;/i&gt;

00:31:11.030 --> 00:31:13.741

00:38:05.069 --> 00:38:06.362
&lt;i&gt;I bought my first computer&lt;/i&gt;

00:38:06.446 --> 00:38:08.364
&lt;i&gt;with the winnings&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;from a chess tournam&lt;/i&gt;ent.

00:38:09.282 --> 00:38:10.783
&lt;i&gt;I sort of had this intuition&lt;/i&gt;

00:38:10.867 --> 00:38:13.244
&lt;i&gt;that computers&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;are this magical device&lt;/i&gt;

00:38:13.327 --> 00:38:14.871
&lt;i&gt;that can extend&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;the power of the mind.&lt;/i&gt;

00:38:15.621 --> 00:38:17.081
&lt;i&gt;I had a couple&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;of school friends,&lt;/i&gt;

00:38:17.165 --> 00:38:18.833
&lt;i&gt;and we used to have&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;a hacking club,&lt;/i&gt;

00:38:18.916 --> 00:38:21.336
&lt;i&gt;writing code, making games.&lt;/i&gt;

00:38:26.049 --> 00:38:27.383
&lt;i&gt;And then over&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;the summer holidays,&lt;/i&gt;

00:38:27.467 --> 00:38:28.843
&lt;i&gt;I'd spend the whole day&lt;/i&gt;

00:38:28.926 --> 00:38:30.762
&lt;i&gt;flicking through&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;games magazines.&lt;/i&gt;

00:38:31.429 --> 00:38:33.139
&lt;i&gt;And one day I noticed&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;there was a competition&lt;/i&gt;

00:38:33.222 --> 00:38:35.433
&lt;i&gt;to write an original version&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;of Space Invaders.&lt;/i&gt;

00:38:35.516 --> 00:38:37.935
&lt;i&gt;And the winner won a job&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;at Bullfrog.&lt;/i&gt;

00:38:39.395 --> 00:38:41.773
&lt;i&gt;Bullfrog at the time was the&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;best game development house&lt;/i&gt;

00:38:41.856 --> 00:38:43.358
&lt;i&gt;in all of Europe.&lt;/i&gt;

00:38:43.441 --> 00:38:44.984
&lt;i&gt;You know, I really wanted&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;to work at this place&lt;/i&gt;

00:38:45.068 --> 00:38:46.778
&lt;i&gt;and see how they build games.&lt;/i&gt;

00:38:48.363 --> 00:38:49.906
NEWSCASTER: &lt;i&gt;Bullfrog,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;based here in Guildford,&lt;/i&gt;

00:38:49.989 --> 00:38:51.949
&lt;i&gt;began with a big idea.&lt;/i&gt;

00:38:52.033 --> 00:38:54.202
&lt;i&gt;That idea turned into the game&lt;/i&gt;
Populous,

00:38:54.285 --> 00:38:56.287
&lt;i&gt;which became&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;a global bestseller.&lt;/i&gt;

00:38:56.371 --> 00:38:59.665
In the '90s, there was
no recruitment agencies.

00:38:59.749 --> 00:39:02.043
You couldn't go out and say,
you know,

00:39:02.126 --> 00:39:04.504
"Come and work
in the games industry."

00:39:04.587 --> 00:39:07.006
It was still not even
considered an industry.

00:39:08.007 --> 00:39:10.843
&lt;i&gt;So we came up with the idea&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;to have a competition&lt;/i&gt;

00:39:10.927 --> 00:39:13.262
&lt;i&gt;and we got&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;a lot of applicants.&lt;/i&gt;

00:39:14.263 --> 00:39:16.516
&lt;i&gt;And one of those was Demis's.&lt;/i&gt;

00:39:17.225 --> 00:39:19.644
I can still remember clearly

00:39:20.436 --> 00:39:22.647
the day that Demis came in.

00:39:23.606 --> 00:39:26.567
&lt;i&gt;He walked in the door,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;he looked about 12.&lt;/i&gt;

00:39:28.194 --> 00:39:29.195
I thought, "Oh, my God,

00:39:29.278 --> 00:39:31.072
"what the hell are we going
to do with this guy?"

00:39:31.155 --> 00:39:32.573
I applied to Cambridge.

00:39:32.657 --> 00:39:35.076
I got in but they said
I was way too young.

00:39:35.159 --> 00:39:37.412
So...
So I needed to take a year off

00:39:37.495 --> 00:39:39.372
so I'd be at least 17
before I got there.

00:39:39.789 --> 00:39:42.291
&lt;i&gt;And that's when I decided&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;to spend that entire gap year&lt;/i&gt;

00:39:42.375 --> 00:39:43.793
&lt;i&gt;working at Bullfrog.&lt;/i&gt;

00:39:44.252 --> 00:39:45.753
&lt;i&gt;They couldn't even&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;legally employ me,&lt;/i&gt;

00:39:45.837 --> 00:39:47.714
&lt;i&gt;so I ended up being paid&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;in brown paper envelopes.&lt;/i&gt;

00:39:47.797 --> 00:39:48.840
(CHUCKLES)

00:39:50.591 --> 00:39:53.928
&lt;i&gt;I got a feeling of being&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;really at the cutting edge&lt;/i&gt;

00:39:54.012 --> 00:39:57.640
&lt;i&gt;and how much fun that was&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;to invent things every day.&lt;/i&gt;

00:39:57.724 --> 00:39:59.308
And then you know,
a few months later,

00:40:00.351 --> 00:40:02.520
maybe everyone... a million
people will be playing it.

00:40:03.438 --> 00:40:06.357
MOLYNEUX: &lt;i&gt;In those days&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;computer games had to evolve.&lt;/i&gt;

00:40:06.441 --> 00:40:08.192
&lt;i&gt;There had to be new genres&lt;/i&gt;

00:40:08.276 --> 00:40:10.695
&lt;i&gt;which were more&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;than just shooting things.&lt;/i&gt;

00:40:11.362 --> 00:40:13.656
Wouldn't it be amazing
to have a game

00:40:13.740 --> 00:40:18.327
where you design and build
your own theme park?

(GAME CHARACTERS SCREAMING)

00:40:22.331 --> 00:40:25.501
&lt;i&gt;Demis and I started to talk&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;about&lt;/i&gt; Theme Park.

00:40:25.585 --> 00:40:28.588
&lt;i&gt;It allows the player&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;to build a world&lt;/i&gt;

00:40:28.671 --> 00:40:31.382
&lt;i&gt;and see the consequences&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;of your choices&lt;/i&gt;

00:40:31.466 --> 00:40:33.760
&lt;i&gt;that you've made&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;in that world.&lt;/i&gt;

00:40:34.177 --> 00:40:35.678
HASSABIS: &lt;i&gt;A human player&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;set out the layout&lt;/i&gt;

00:40:35.762 --> 00:40:38.306
&lt;i&gt;of the theme park and designed&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;the roller coaster&lt;/i&gt;

00:40:38.389 --> 00:40:40.975
&lt;i&gt;and set the prices&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;in the chip shop.&lt;/i&gt;

00:40:41.059 --> 00:40:43.102
&lt;i&gt;What I was working on was&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;the behaviors of the people.&lt;/i&gt;

00:40:43.186 --> 00:40:44.729
&lt;i&gt;They were autonomous&lt;/i&gt;

00:40:44.812 --> 00:40:46.939
&lt;i&gt;and that was the AI&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;in this case.&lt;/i&gt;

00:40:47.023 --> 00:40:48.399
So what I was trying to do
was mimic

00:40:48.483 --> 00:40:50.735
interesting human behavior

00:40:50.818 --> 00:40:51.986
so that the simulation
would be

00:40:52.070 --> 00:40:53.404
more interesting
to interact with.

00:40:54.322 --> 00:40:56.199
MOLYNEUX: &lt;i&gt;Demis worked&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;on ridiculous things,&lt;/i&gt;

00:40:56.282 --> 00:40:59.285
&lt;i&gt;like you could place down&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;these shops&lt;/i&gt;

00:40:59.369 --> 00:41:03.331
&lt;i&gt;and if you put a shop too near&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;a very dangerous ride,&lt;/i&gt;

00:41:03.414 --> 00:41:05.041
&lt;i&gt;then people on the ride&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;would throw up&lt;/i&gt;

00:41:05.124 --> 00:41:06.959
&lt;i&gt;because they'd just eaten.&lt;/i&gt;

00:41:07.669 --> 00:41:09.337
And then that would make
other people throw up

00:41:09.420 --> 00:41:11.714
when they saw the throwing-up
on the floor,

00:41:11.798 --> 00:41:14.217
so you then had to have
lots of sweepers

00:41:14.300 --> 00:41:17.345
&lt;i&gt;to quickly sweep it up&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;before the people saw it.&lt;/i&gt;

00:41:17.428 --> 00:41:19.013
&lt;i&gt;That's the cool thing&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;about it.&lt;/i&gt;

00:41:19.097 --> 00:41:22.058
&lt;i&gt;You as the player tinker with&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;it and then it reacts to you.&lt;/i&gt;

00:41:22.600 --> 00:41:25.395

&lt;i&gt;simulation things he did&lt;/i&gt;

00:41:25.478 --> 00:41:27.689
and that was an invention

00:41:27.772 --> 00:41:30.274
which never really
existed before.

00:41:31.025 --> 00:41:33.361

&lt;i&gt;to be a top ten title&lt;/i&gt;

00:41:36.864 --> 00:41:39.492
and that was the first time
we were starting to see

00:41:39.575 --> 00:41:42.578
how AI could make
a difference.

&lt;i&gt;to take us home.&lt;/i&gt;

00:41:51.045 --> 00:41:54.507
I have this very clear memory
of Demis talking about AI

00:41:54.590 --> 00:41:55.675
in a very different way,

00:41:55.758 --> 00:41:58.052
in a way that we didn't
commonly talk about.

00:41:58.136 --> 00:42:02.015
This idea of AI being useful
for other things

00:42:02.098 --> 00:42:03.641
other than entertainment.

helping the world

and the potential of AI
to change the world.

I just said to Demis,
"What is it you want to do?"

00:42:12.942 --> 00:42:14.193
And he said to me,

00:42:14.277 --> 00:42:16.404
"I want to be the person
that solves AI."

&lt;i&gt;from the beginning.&lt;/i&gt;

00:44:38.087 --> 00:44:39.797

how computers and brains

they control everything,

&lt;i&gt;of amino acids&lt;/i&gt;

00:46:32.368 --> 00:46:35.538
&lt;i&gt;that fold up to create&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;a protein structure.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;that you could begin&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;to think about.&lt;/i&gt;

00:46:53.473 --> 00:46:54.599
I kind of thought,

00:46:54.682 --> 00:46:57.852
"Well, is a human being
clever enough

00:46:57.935 --> 00:46:59.479
"to actually fold a protein?"

00:46:59.562 --> 00:47:01.189
&lt;i&gt;We can't work it out.&lt;/i&gt;

00:47:01.814 --> 00:47:03.566

00:47:03.649 --> 00:47:05.109
&lt;i&gt;we thought that in principle,&lt;/i&gt;

00:47:05.693 --> 00:47:08.571
&lt;i&gt;if I know what the amino acid&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;sequence of a protein is,&lt;/i&gt;

00:47:08.654 --> 00:47:11.032
&lt;i&gt;I should be able to compute&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;what the structure's like.&lt;/i&gt;

00:47:11.115 --> 00:47:13.409
So if you could
just press a button,

00:47:13.493 --> 00:47:15.870

popping out, that would be...

00:47:15.953 --> 00:47:17.580

00:47:21.250 --> 00:47:23.252
&lt;i&gt;"Oh, this is&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;a very interesting problem."&lt;/i&gt;

00:47:23.336 --> 00:47:25.630
&lt;i&gt;And it felt to me&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;like it would be solvable.&lt;/i&gt;

the possibilities

solve this problem.

it would have an incredible
kind of medical relevance.

&lt;i&gt;of exploration,&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;and then you go&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;into exploitation mode,&lt;/i&gt;

00:51:31.668 --> 00:51:33.127
and you focus and you see

are those ideas, really?

&lt;i&gt;for that.&lt;/i&gt;

00:51:39.467 --> 00:51:42.762
&lt;i&gt;So we decided&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;to enter CASP competition.&lt;/i&gt;

00:51:42.845 --> 00:51:46.891

to try and speed up

00:51:46.974 --> 00:51:49.435
the solution to
the protein folding problem.

00:51:49.519 --> 00:51:51.688
CASP is when we say,

00:51:51.771 --> 00:51:53.856
"Look, DeepMind
is doing protein folding,

00:51:53.940 --> 00:51:54.982
"this is how good we are,

00:51:55.066 --> 00:51:57.193
"and maybe it's better
than everybody else.

00:51:57.276 --> 00:51:58.277
"Maybe it isn't."

00:51:59.112 --> 00:52:00.113
CASP is a bit like

00:52:00.196 --> 00:52:01.614

of protein folding.

00:52:03.241 --> 00:52:05.743
&lt;i&gt;CASP is&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;a community-wide assessment&lt;/i&gt;

00:52:05.827 --> 00:52:07.662

&lt;i&gt;of about 100 proteins,&lt;/i&gt;

00:52:14.002 --> 00:52:17.046
&lt;i&gt;and then they try&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;to solve this folding problem&lt;/i&gt;

going to tackle
the protein folding issue,

We entered it into CASP

00:56:18.079 --> 00:56:20.206
was the most accurate,
uh, predicting structures

00:56:20.289 --> 00:56:24.585
for 25 out of the 43 proteins
in the hardest category.
